# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on property characteristics and location-related features.

This project analyzes housing data, performs extensive exploratory data analysis, builds multiple regression models, and identifies the best-performing model for accurate house price prediction.

# 📌 Project Overview

House prices are influenced by multiple factors such as location, size, number of rooms, construction quality, and neighborhood characteristics.

The primary objective of this project is to:

✅ Analyze housing market data

✅ Discover important factors affecting house prices

✅ Build and compare multiple regression models

✅ Predict house prices with high accuracy

---

# 🧠 Machine Learning Problem Type

This is a **Supervised Machine Learning Regression Problem**.

### Target Variable:

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Several valuable insights were identified during EDA:

✅ Larger living areas generally lead to higher house prices.

✅ Overall quality is one of the strongest predictors of price.

✅ Garage capacity and basement area positively influence house value.

✅ Newly constructed or renovated houses usually have higher prices.

✅ Certain neighborhoods consistently command premium prices.
